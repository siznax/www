<h1 style="text-align: center">How We Got Here</h1>

<p>Like many people, I wonder how we got here. How could we make
someone like Donald Trump president of the United States? How could
the polls and the media get it so wrong? How does someone remain in
power when things seem to be falling apart?</p>

<p>The reporting and analysis that makes the most sense to me suggests
that Trump got elected all on his own. Using merely his business
acumen, and social media and reality television skills to exploit the
popularity-driven nature of <i>new media</i> and the <i>attention
economy</i>, he was able to side-step traditional politics. Trump
stunned mainstream media and established politics by simply ignoring
them.</p>

<p>With the advent of the world-wide web and social media, along with
the ubiquity of mobile devices, news and information has become so
widely available that <i>attention</i> has become the limiting factor
in the consumption of information and therefore a valuable
commodity. In this so-called attention economy, attention translates
into cash and opportunity. Think social media
&ldquo;influencers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>By watching these trends and by studying public figures and crowd
behavior, Trump experimented and found he could generate far more
attention by repeating and amplifying only the most popular views,
essentially imitating social media algorithms.</p>

<p>Trump crafted his views, policies, and remarks to speak directly to
consumers of the most popular content on new media platforms like
video games, virtual worlds, interactive web sites, reality
television, and social media.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~</p>

<p>New media content generation is optimized for views, likes, shares,
and comments, collectively called <i>engagement</i>, with little or no
value placed on the subject of the content, its veracity or
validity. Views are similar to ratings in traditional media, but there
is no concept of shares, likes, or comment activity.</p>

<p>The success of new media content is heavily dependent on
engagement. In overly simplistic terms the content that generates the
most combined views, shares, likes, and comment activity rises to the
top. Consumers of this content willingly provide sensitive personal
information for access to new media platforms and create a huge amount
of data about their tastes and preferences on them.</p>

<p>This information is used to further optimize engagement through
personalization, and is only accessible to new media companies that
enable the creation of this &ldquo;proprietary data&rdquo;. By
comparison, traditional media has very limited knowledge of its
consumers.</p>

<p>Some new media companies like social media giants Facebook and
Twitter claim that they do not <i>create</i> content and are not
responsible for what is engaging or
&ldquo;trending&rdquo;. Traditional media is responsible for its
content because it creates it, and is beholden to readers and
advertisers that agree to a certain standard.</p>

<p>Only new media can &ldquo;give the people what they want&rdquo;
because it is determined by what is empirically proven to be popular
among them in the current moment with almost total knowledge of the
consumer and consumer trends, and sophisticated strategies augmented
by artificial intelligence. Traditional media must attempt to predict
what the people may want in the future from a narrow range of limited
choices with only publicly available knowledge.</p>

<p>Some new media organizations do create content, and expressly for
the purpose of driving engagement. Savvy creators shape new content
from aspects of existing popular content that stands out as a proven
source of engagement. For instance, it could be derived from a comment
on a story that is more popular than the story itself.</p>

<p>Social media companies often create and disseminate material to
educate content creators about what drives engagement and how to use
their platform to maximize it.</p>

<p>The source of the content and the nature of its subject matter is
largely irrelevant. The area of maximum engagement is identified,
magnified, extrapolated, repeated and amplified until even more
engaging aspects can be discovered or something more engaging subsumes
it.</p>

<p>This process is constantly optimized by sophisticated computer
algorithms so that the most engaging content is always most
available. New media content creators accept responsibility for their
content only to the extent that it increases engagement. New media
platforms accept responsibility for amplifying this content only to
the extent required by law. Even the law can be skirted by redirecting
consumers to the same content elsewhere in tricky ways.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~</p>

<p>Trump had been considering entering politics for some time and
appeared to be waiting for his opportunity. He would need access to
the ballot and a lot of cash. He could relate to the attention economy
and explored ways of exploiting it, understanding that attention
equals engagement and engagement equals cash and opportunity.</p>

<p>He knew that if enough <i>voters</i> could be persuaded to behave
as consumers do in the attention economy, then those voters could
elect as president a leader in the attention economy. Trump
experimented with this dynamic until he found success.</p>

<p>While mainstream media and the political establishment concerns
itself with issues, polls, votes, and approval ratings under severe
constraints, the attention economy simply amplifies engagement
unbounded. In the same way the &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo; enables the
success of AirBnb and Uber by skirting business norms, market
barriers, and regulation new media and the attention economy are
enabling the success of new media politicians by skirting journalists,
pundits and pollsâ€”and potentially even the voting booth.</p>

<p>Trump has many unwitting partners at his disposal to accelerate
engagement metrics including protestors, outspoken critics, frustrated
journalists, angry politicians, injured officials, rioters,
vigilantes, foreign actors, and internet platforms that optimize for
attention. This makes Twitter and Facebook relevant only to the extent
that their algorithms optimize for the most engaging content, and they
are beholden to this practice by stake holders.</p>

<p>This frustrates traditional media in many ways, but perhaps most
importantly it removes them from influencing what messaging is most
popular. Where an editor or producer may be compelled to reject
potentially popular content based on a variety of factors, new media
reduces content choice to the most attention-grabbing bits with the
pinpoint accuracy and cold efficiency of the most informed,
sophisticated, connected, restless, and durable systems ever
known.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~</p>

<p>Where traditional media may focus on properly honoring the life of
a fallen civil rights hero, the attention economy thrives on whatever
is driving engagement in the moment. It may be a celebrity comment one
minute or a conspiracy theory the next. All that is needed on the part
of the new media politician is to fan the flames of engagement.</p>

<p>Furthermore, traditional media can only cover popular new media
content to the extent that it is palatable to traditional consumers
and professional journalism. This makes them largely irrelevant to new
media consumers.</p>

<p>While traditional media and politics react to the rhythms of press
briefings and news cycles that tend to change on the order of days and
weeks, new media and the attention economy exists within the rhythm of
the moment, having the ability to change their focus and messaging to
what is currently generating the most engagement.</p>

<p>By entering politics in command of new media in an attention
economy, Trump essentially took the monopoly board away from the
political establishment that has become tiresome to so much of the
public. Does this make him a genius? Perhaps.</p>

<p>What is needed now are politicians that understand the dynamics of
new media and the attention economy and how to exploit them. They need
to understand that the traditional systems are no longer useful, or
even in play. They've been made obsolete, deprecated.</p>

<p>They need a new game. Now that enough voters are influenced by new
media in an attention economy, it is not enough to be fair and just as
well as popular; you must be willing <i>and able</i> to tirelessly,
relentlessly win the popularity contest of the moment at all
costs.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">~</p>

<p>Knowing that this is how things may have played out is important to
us all. We must recognize that our system was gamed. It was
defeated. The old system is now at the mercy of the awesome power it
created but no longer has the means to control.</p>

<p>The days of appealing to voters on issues is over. There are no
longer enough voters that have confidence in the current system. While
newspapers, radio, and television struggle incessantly over issues,
briefings, pundits, polls, ratings, and votes, the new media
politician ignores it all and simply rides the wave of engagement to
victory.<p>

<p>As new media rises and the inequity of the attention economy grows,
more new media consumers will become voters. Where traditional
politicians use new media and the attention economy to supplement
their campaigns, the new media politician must make it the nexus of
their campaign strategy.</p>
